    Effectivness of ppdb :
         Experiments :
               Pruning ppdb with the same procedure in majid's work and check the results
               Intersection and Union results
               
    Graph Construction with features as edge:
         Experiments :
              Comparing different types of pruning techniques
              Learning parameters on edges , example a uniform distribution, to show which features of ppdb are more usful.

    Graph propagation:
         Experiments:
               Examining where graph propagation can help, for example for numbers, named entities it is not working. Maybe some morphological features are required.
